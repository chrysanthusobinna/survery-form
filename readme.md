### Running the Website
The website is now ready to run.

### Features
- Users can view questions and respond to them seamlessly without page reloading.
- User details and responses are stored in the database.
- Admin page can be accessed by visiting `http://localhost/admin` where you can:
  - View responses
  - Edit responses
  - Delete responses
  - Add questions
  - Delete questions
  - Set range like min score and max score
  - Choose which question score should be counted or skipped when the total score is computed.

## Development Choices

### jQuery
I used jQuery to create a user-friendly form and seamless responses for users without page loading.

### jQuery DataTable Library
I utilized the jQuery DataTable library to make loading patients seamless, with integrated search and sort functionalities.

### Dynamic Website
  -The website is dynamic, allowing more questions to be added and providing flexibility in choosing which question scores should be counted or not.
  - Displaying one question at a time to improve the user experience and make the form more manageable.
  - Offering options for both single response edits and bulk response edits to streamline data management.




### Validation and Data Sanitization
To ensure data integrity and security:
- **Validation**: All input fields are validated to ensure that only correct and expected data is processed.
- **Data Sanitization**: Input data is sanitized to prevent injection attacks and maintain data consistency.
